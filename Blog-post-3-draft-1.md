# Exercising Eavesdropping--It's Surprisingly a Good Thing

## How an exercise in social and spacial awareness helped me come back to myself

Frankly, I hate poetry.

Not so much reading poetry, for I enjoy submerging myself in vignettes. It's a restricted world in there, and I'd rather put my energy somewhere else.

I really can't get *how* people write these things...and enjoy it enough to do it forever.

But, nonetheless, the creative writing department at my university requires each student to take at least one poetry class. So, I had no choice.

(Put something here about the class, how the first workshop session I ever did in there turned out a total disaster, etc.)

Surprisingly, my professor gave us a task that I gradually fell in love with.

"You guys are going to take your notebooks and every day I want you to write at least five pieces of something memorable or odd that strikes you every day. It can be something that happens to you or something that you witness on the streets, but they have to be different. Try to use them in your writing for inspiration when you want."

"It's an exercise in eavesdropping," she said, winking before letting us go.

What was I supposed to write? Pathetically enough, I didn't really have that much of a life. No crazy parties or weekends out drinking or whatever. I'm not really the kind of person to acquire crazy experiences on a regular basis.

(Go into later why this exercise in becoming more aware of my surroundings and other people helped me come back to myself and become more positive; include examples of weird/odd/humorous things that I overheard or observed in others (for some reason something about a duck is coming back to me...), which I would have never noticed if I was walking as I normally do, like listening to music while walking. Encourage others to make it a habit too and actively write these moments down to keep yourself accountable. It also doesn't have to be being aware all the time every single day but maybe just while walking to work in the morning or sitting somewhere for a few hours when you aren't doing anything, etc. This exercise also helped me expand what I considered humorous or odd and striking. It helped me become more appreciative and empathetic, since sometimes the most striking thing during the day that I wrote could have been someone I saw looking extremely happy about something.)
